# Ryan's Domoticz Scripts

Backed up to github, and published as examples to help with your own scripts.

After accidently deleting all my scripts I decided to simply back them up with github, luckilly I had shared and borrowed many of them. 

I store all these files in ~/bin and then symlink them into ~/domoticz/scripts so I perform clean installs safely.

hope you'll find them usefull.
